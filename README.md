This is a small personal project that is based on the "Tkinter" Python package and is a GUI Desktop App.
Basically, the user can type freely on the app and whenever the typing stops for more than 5 seconds, all the text is being erased automatically.
The project is inspired by the known "The Most Dangerous Writing App" that is an online tool designed to overcome writer's block. It enforces continuous writing by erasing the user's entire text if they pause for more than five seconds, thereby encouraging a free-flowing, unedited first draft.
